* extern
The extern keyword tells the compiler that a variable or function is defined elsewhere, possibly in another file.
As long as the variable or fucntion is not declared as static.
#+begin_src c
// file1.c
int counter = 0;

// file2.c
extern int counter;  // refers to the same counter defined in file1.c
extern void print_result();  // function defined in another file
#+end_src


#+begin_src c
// It is still global (lives the whole program), but only visible within that file.
static int count = 0;
#+end_src
